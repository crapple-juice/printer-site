# Welcome!
The Nason Hall Xerox machine offers a donation-funded, community-run printing service for anybody at Rensselaer
Polytechnic institute to use. It is located in the Nason Hall 1st floor lounge by the kitchenette, but in the back
corner.

# Funding
To be clear, paying is not *necessary,* just strongly encouraged. Printing just a few pages may not seem like much
money, but it adds up. Servicing the machine gets expensive (on the order of hundreds of dollars), but when you
calculate the cost of printing, one cent easily pays for three pages:

| A penny | A dime | A quarter | A dollar |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|
|  3 pgs  | 30 pgs |  75 pgs   | 300 pgs! |

Moral of the story: **Your pocket change can, over time, fund the printer.** If you print, please donate. I don't want
to make it a pay-per-print thing since it's a pain in the ass.

# Paper Trays
There are 5 paper trays in the machine (but only 4 internal). Please make sure you put the right paper in the right tray
and make sure you print from the right tray:

* Tray 1 - 8.5x11 in - Both sides blank. **Please use only for double sided prints.**
* Tray 2 - 8.5x11 in - Only one side blank. This enables paper re-use. Use this paper for single-page prints, like calc
recitation worksheets. **Put the paper in used side up.** Old cover sheets are ideal for this.

Please make sure you don't put in any wrinkled or otherwise ratty paper in the printer since it can jam. **Please don't
try to fix paper jams yourself.**

# Usage
You can print off a flash drive only at the moment, but a web print function is coming soon. The copier and scanner is
missing a few screws, so it doesn't (yet) work. If you encounter any issues, **please text the phone number on the
machine.**

## General Rules
* Before using the machine, please **sanitize your hands**
* Please **pick the correct paper tray.** See [above](#paper-trays)
* You may add paper, but **please don't try to fix jams yourself**, even via the onscreen instructions
* I guess don't break anything
* Please don't do/print anything that gets us in trouble...

## Printing via a flash drive
**TODO:** Add pictures

* Put your file on a USB drive
* Plug the USB drive into the printer
* Click "Print from" on the screen. If it's off, hit the power button once quickly
