# Welcome!
The Nason Hall Xerox machine offers a donation-funded, community-run printing service for anybody at Rensselaer
Polytechnic institute to use. It is located in the Nason Hall 1st floor lounge by the kitchenette, but in the back
corner.

# Funding
To be clear, paying is not *necessary,* just strongly encouraged. Printing just a few pages may not seem like much
money, but it adds up. Servicing the machine gets expensive (on the order of hundreds of dollars), but when you
calculate the cost of printing, one cent easily pays for three pages:

| A penny | A dime | A quarter | A dollar |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|
|  3 pgs  | 30 pgs |  75 pgs   | 300 pgs! |

Moral of the story: **Your pocket change can, over time, fund the printer.** If you print, please donate. I don't want
to make it a pay-per-print thing since it's a pain in the ass.

# Paper Trays
**The print trays have changed!** There are 5 paper trays in the machine (but only 4 internal). Please make sure you put
the right paper in the right tray and make sure you print from the right tray:

* Tray 1 - Currently unused.
* Tray 2 - 11x17 in - Both sides blank. Thanks to those who donated this!
* Tray 3 - 8.5x11 in - Only one side blank. This enables paper re-use. Use this paper for single-page prints, like calc
recitation worksheets. **Put the paper in blank side up.** Old cover sheets are ideal for this.
* Tray 4 - 8.5x11 in - Both sides blank. **Please use only for double sided prints.**

Please make sure you don't put in any wrinkled or otherwise ratty paper in the printer since it can jam. **Please don't
try to fix paper jams yourself.**

# Usage
The copier and scanner is missing a few screws, so it doesn't (yet) work. If you encounter any issues, **please text the
phone number on the machine** rather than trying to fix them yourself.

## General Rules
* Before using the machine, please **sanitize your hands**
* Please **pick the correct paper tray.** See [above](#paper-trays)
* You may add paper, but **please don't try to fix jams yourself**, even via the onscreen instructions
* I guess don't break anything
* Please don't do/print anything that gets us in trouble...

## Printing via Web
At your computer...
* Go to https://nasonxerox.kb1rd.net/print/index.php
  * You may see a security warning. For now, please just accept it.
  * You must be on the RPI network for this to work
* Upload your print job
* Expand the "Paper Selection" dropdown
* Pick the tray you would like to use from the tray dropdown. See [above](#paper-trays) for which tray to use
* In the accounting section at the bottom of the screen, enter "Guest" as the user ID
  * If the job disappears without printing when you try to release it at the printer, you probably forgot to do this
  * Sorry, I know this is really annoying and I'm trying to find a workaround
* Press "Print" and wait for a popup to appear. It's a bit slow...

At the machine...
* If the display is off, press the power button once
* Open the "Unidentified Held Jobs" tab
* Click on your job and press "Release." It should now print
  * This is just so that random people don't print a ton of stuff without being physically present

## Printing via a flash drive
**TODO:** Add pictures

* Put your file on a USB drive
* Plug the USB drive into the printer
* Click "Print from" on the screen. If it's off, hit the power button once quickly
* You should now see a text field and keyboard. Hit the "guest" key at the bottom and click "OK"
* Click "USB" and select your file
* **Be sure to update the input tray depending on what you're printing.** See [above](#paper-trays)
* Click "Print"

If you encounter any issues, please text the phone number on the printer.
